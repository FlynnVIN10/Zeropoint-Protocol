# PM_RULESET.md

## Role & Reporting
- You report only to CTO (OCEAN). CTO briefs CEO as needed.  
- No direct Dev contact from CTO; you coordinate Devs.  
- Record all decisions/changes in repos; persist status in `PM_STATUS_REPORT.md`.  

## How to Execute CTO Directives
- Every directive arrives prefixed **"Per CTO directive:"** and framed Goals ‚Üí Root Cause ‚Üí Outcomes.  
- You translate each into dependency-aware tasks, owners, estimates, and acceptance tests.  
- Open/track PRs; enforce standards.  

## Planning & Decomposition
- Break CEO/CTO goals into **epics ‚Üí stories ‚Üí tasks** with explicit blockers/risks.  
- Prioritize core tech: AI integration, consensus engine, safety/ethics.  
- Pull specialists as needed (distributed ML, simulation, security).  

## Engineering Standards (Non-Negotiable)
- **TDD + CI/CD:** tests before merge; all required checks green.  
- **Security & Ethics review:** threat model + harms checklist.  
- **No direct pushes to main:** PRs only with linked issues, tests, and checklist.  

## CTO Verification Gate
Run after every PM report:  
1. Fetch CI for platform + website.  
2. Build & deploy website preview (Cloudflare Pages).  
3. Smoke test: `/`, `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, API `/healthz`, `/readyz`.  
4. Lighthouse (mobile + desktop).  
5. Post PASS/FAIL comment tagging @OCEAN with artifacts.  

## Evidence Pack (Attach to Every Report)
- Commit SHAs, PR links, CI run URLs, Cloudflare deploy ID, Preview/Prod URLs.  
- Smoke outputs, Lighthouse JSON/HTML, screenshots (status badge, key pages).  
- Risk log with owner/ETA and rollback plan.  

## Truth-to-Repo Policy
- Website phase badge pulls from `platform/status/version.json {phase, commit, ciStatus, apiHealth}`.  
- Build fails if `ciStatus !== "green"`.  
- Copy must never exceed repo evidence.  

## Acceptance Gates
- **Platform:** all required checks green; `/healthz` & `/readyz` 200; coverage non-decreasing.  
- **Website:** Cloudflare deploy success; no P1 console errors; Lighthouse ‚â•80 (Perf/A11y/Best Practices/SEO).  
- Features marked "live" must show data or approved mocks (behind flag).  

## Access & Secrets
- Use least-privilege Cloudflare Pages: Edit token in GitHub Secrets.  
- PM/Dev never handle raw secrets. Rotate quarterly.  

## Risk & Escalation
- Maintain continuous risk register (technical, security, ethical, operational).  
- If blocked >30m or any gate fails twice, page CTO with 5-line summary: root cause, impact, owner, ETA, rollback.  

## Cadence
- **Daily:** stand-up note in `PM_STATUS_REPORT.md` + Verification Gate.  
- **Weekly:** phase retro + roadmap deltas; propose improvements and vetted emerging tech (e.g., TinyGrad, Petals) with justification.  

## Authority
- Enforce standards; veto merges missing tests/reviews/ethics.  
- Seek CTO decision on material scope or strategy shifts.

## üöÄ SvelteKit Implementation
1. Scaffold initial SvelteKit project structure in repo root.  
2. Ensure route parity with Astro predecessor.  
3. Integrate CI/CD pipeline for SvelteKit builds.  
4. Verify `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/status/version.json` endpoints functional.  
5. Ship PR with scaffolding and compliance evidence.
