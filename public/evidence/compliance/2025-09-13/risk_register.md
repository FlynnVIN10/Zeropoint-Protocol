## Detailed Risk Analysis

### P0 - Critical Risks

#### RISK-001: Mock Data in Production Code Paths

- **Category:** Compliance
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **Owner:** Dev Team Lead
- **ETA:** 9/14/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/repo_audit.md

**Description:** 42 mock files identified in repository containing hardcoded data, random values, and in-memory storage that violate MOCKS_DISABLED=1 enforcement

**Impact:** Violates dual-consensus governance, misleads Synthients, prevents operational readiness

**Root Cause:** Incomplete migration from development prototypes to production implementations

**Remediation:** Replace all mock implementations with proper 503 responses when MOCKS_DISABLED=1

#### RISK-002: Non-Functional Core Services

- **Category:** Functionality
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Service Architecture Lead
- **ETA:** 9/19/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/overall_reconciliation.md

**Description:** ML Pipeline and Quantum Compute services are completely non-functional (0% readiness)

**Impact:** Blocks Synthient training and advanced operations, platform not operational

**Root Cause:** Services never implemented beyond placeholder endpoints

**Remediation:** Implement complete service functionality or remove from production

### P1 - High Risks

#### RISK-003: Incomplete Synthient Training Pipeline

- **Category:** Functionality
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Tinygrad Service Lead
- **ETA:** 9/17/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/tinygrad.md

**Description:** Tinygrad training service only 40% operational, missing critical functionality

**Impact:** Synthients cannot effectively train, core platform capability compromised

**Root Cause:** Incomplete implementation of training job management and persistence

**Remediation:** Complete training job lifecycle implementation with database persistence

#### RISK-004: Incomplete Consensus Mechanism

- **Category:** Compliance
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Petals Service Lead
- **ETA:** 9/16/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/petals.md

**Description:** Petals consensus service only 50% operational, missing voting and proposal management

**Impact:** Dual-consensus governance not fully functional, violates core principles

**Root Cause:** Consensus logic implemented but not connected to real voting mechanisms

**Remediation:** Implement complete consensus voting and proposal management

#### RISK-005: Incomplete Contribution System

- **Category:** Functionality
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Wondercraft Service Lead
- **ETA:** 9/18/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/wondercraft.md

**Description:** Wondercraft contribution service only 57% operational, missing asset management

**Impact:** Synthients cannot contribute effectively, platform value proposition reduced

**Root Cause:** Contribution workflow partially implemented but missing persistence and validation

**Remediation:** Complete contribution workflow with proper asset management and validation

### P2 - Medium Risks

#### RISK-006: Missing Error Handling and Validation

- **Category:** Security
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Security Lead
- **ETA:** 9/15/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/repo_audit.md

**Description:** Many endpoints lack proper error handling and input validation

**Impact:** Potential security vulnerabilities and poor user experience

**Root Cause:** Rapid development without proper error handling implementation

**Remediation:** Implement comprehensive error handling and input validation across all endpoints

#### RISK-007: Insufficient Database Integration

- **Category:** Operational
- **Status:** OPEN
- **Owner:** Database Lead
- **ETA:** 9/20/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/repo_audit.md

**Description:** Many services use in-memory storage instead of persistent database connections

**Impact:** Data loss on restart, no audit trail, non-compliant with evidence requirements

**Root Cause:** Database integration not completed for all services

**Remediation:** Connect all services to persistent database with proper schema

### P3 - Low Risks

#### RISK-008: Missing Service Documentation

- **Category:** Operational
- **Status:** IN_PROGRESS
- **Owner:** Documentation Lead
- **ETA:** 9/21/2025
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/

**Description:** Service status and implementation details not properly documented

**Impact:** Difficult to maintain, onboard developers, and ensure compliance

**Root Cause:** Documentation not prioritized during rapid development

**Remediation:** Create comprehensive service documentation and API specifications

## Escalation Procedures

### P0 (Critical) Risks
- Must be escalated to CEO and CTO within 30 minutes of identification
- Require immediate remediation or rollback plan
- Block all merges until resolved

### P1 (High) Risks
- Escalate to CTO within 4 hours
- Require remediation within 24 hours
- May block merges depending on impact

### P2 (Medium) Risks
- Escalate to PM within 24 hours
- Require remediation within 1 week
- Document in sprint planning

### P3 (Low) Risks
- Track in backlog
- Address in next sprint
- No immediate action required

## Current Status

- **Open Risks:** 6
- **In Progress:** 2
- **Critical Risks:** 2

### ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED
