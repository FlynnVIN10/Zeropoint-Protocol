# PM Status Report
  **Date**: 2025-08-01  
  **Phase**: 10 & 11  
  **Status**: Blocked  
  **Assigned To**: Dev Team  
  **Approved By**: CTO, CEO  

  ## Current Status
  - **License/CLA**: Enforced; no issues.
  - **Phase 10**: Optimization implemented; blocked by 100% UI auth failure (missing Authorization header).
  - **Phase 11**: UE5 prototyping ready; blocked by auth issue.
  - **Website**: Commit push and real-time integration blocked by auth dependency.
  - **GDPR**: Audit complete; no PII exposure; bi-weekly audits ongoing.
  - **Next Steps**: Fix frontend auth flow, validate load/auth fixes, push website commit, integrate real-time data, advance UE5 prototyping.

  ## Issues
  - Critical: 100% UI authentication failure (Missing or invalid Authorization header); blocks all testing and progress.
  - Concurrent load performance (previously 221.17ms, 92.54% uptime) pending validation after auth fix.
