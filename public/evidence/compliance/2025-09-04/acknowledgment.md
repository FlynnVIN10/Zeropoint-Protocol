# SCRA Acknowledgment: Zeropoint Protocol Stage 1 Compliance

**Date:** September 4, 2025  
**Commit:** `6a3f4ea8d426746161a99d4bf8c84e321d9047fb`  
**Status:** ✅ **STAGE 1 COMPLIANCE VERIFIED**

## SCRA Verification Results

### Compliance Assessment
The Synthient Compliance & Research Analyst (SCRA) has completed comprehensive verification of the Zeropoint Protocol Stage 1 deployment and confirms **full Truth-to-Repo compliance** has been achieved.

### Verification Criteria Met
- ✅ **Commit Synchronization**: All status endpoints and evidence files reference commit `6a3f4ea`
- ✅ **Domain Consolidation**: Single production domain (zeropointprotocol.ai) established
- ✅ **Evidence Alignment**: All evidence manifests reference correct commit and file paths
- ✅ **Header Compliance**: Required security headers present on all JSON endpoints
- ✅ **Automated Controls**: Build-time evidence generation prevents future commit-lag
- ✅ **CI/CD Hardening**: Pre-merge verification gates enforce compliance

### Technical Verification
```json
{
  "version_endpoint": "https://zeropointprotocol.ai/status/version.json",
  "commit": "6a3f4ea8d426746161a99d4bf8c84e321d9047fb",
  "evidence_index": "https://zeropointprotocol.ai/evidence/verify/6a3f4ea/index.json",
  "headers_validated": true,
  "compliance_status": "PASS"
}
```

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` ✅
- `Cache-Control: no-store` ✅
- All additional security headers present ✅

## SCRA Findings

### Resolved Issues
1. **Commit-Lag Elimination**: Build-time evidence generation using `CF_PAGES_COMMIT_SHA` prevents future misalignment
2. **Domain Consolidation**: Obsolete Cloudflare subdomains retired, single production domain established
3. **Evidence Drift Prevention**: Automated generation with strict validation prevents evidence inconsistencies
4. **CI/CD Conflicts**: Workflow interference eliminated, verification gates operational

### Risk Assessment
- **Current Risk Level**: LOW
- **Compliance Status**: FULLY COMPLIANT
- **Readiness for Stage 2**: APPROVED

## SCRA Recommendation

**RECOMMENDATION**: Proceed to Stage 2 implementation.

The Zeropoint Protocol Stage 1 deployment has successfully achieved all compliance requirements. The automated controls and evidence generation systems are operational and will maintain compliance for future deployments.
