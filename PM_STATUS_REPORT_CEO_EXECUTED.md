  "completed_today": 15,
  "total_runs": 127,
  "last_run": {...},
  "leaderboard": [...],
  "sources": {
    "petals": {"state": "ok", "active": true, "lastContact": "2025-09-02T04:45:09.764Z"},
    "wondercraft": {"state": "ok", "active": true, "lastContact": "2025-09-02T04:45:09.764Z"}
  }
}
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### API Endpoints Restored
1. **Health Endpoints**
   - `/api/healthz` - Complete JSON contract with phase, ciStatus, commit, buildTime
   - `/api/readyz` - Complete JSON contract with phase, ciStatus, commit, buildTime
   - `/status/version.json` - Version information with commit, buildTime, env

2. **Training Data Aggregation**
   - `/api/training/status` - Live aggregation from provider status URLs
   - Derives `active_runs` from provider `active` flags
   - Exposes `sources` object with provider health and latency
   - Returns `lastContact` timestamps for each provider

3. **Provider Proxies**
   - `/api/providers/petals/{status,exec}` - Internal Petals proxy
   - `/api/providers/wondercraft/{status,exec}` - Internal Wondercraft proxy
   - `/api/providers/tinygrad/{status,exec}` - Internal Tinygrad proxy
   - All proxies support upstream forwarding when configured

4. **Chat System**
   - `/api/router/exec` - Routes to internal Synthient providers by default
   - Supports `?provider=petals|wondercraft|tinygrad` for specific routing
   - Falls back to external LLMs only if configured
   - Returns telemetry with provider, instance, and latency

5. **SSE Streams**
   - `/api/events/consensus` - Consensus updates every 5 seconds
   - `/api/events/synthient` - Synthient processing cycles every 3 seconds
   - Proper `text/event-stream` headers with heartbeats

### Frontend Improvements
1. **CSP Compliance**
   - Moved all inline JavaScript to external file
   - Removed CSP violations
   - Maintained full functionality

2. **Live Data Binding**
   - Training panel updates with real-time provider data
   - Error boundaries and fallback handling
   - Comprehensive debug logging

3. **Chat Interface**
   - Messages append to response area
   - Input remains visible and focused
   - Telemetry display shows provider and latency

4. **SSE Tickers**
   - Top ticker: Consensus events
   - Bottom ticker: Synthient processing cycles
   - Automatic reconnection on disconnect

### Configuration Updates
1. **wrangler.toml**
   - Added AI binding for Workers AI
   - Set default model: `@cf/meta/llama-3.1-8b-instruct`
   - Configured provider status URLs:
     - `PETALS_STATUS_URL = "https://zeropointprotocol.ai/petals/status.json"`
     - `WONDERCRAFT_STATUS_URL = "https://zeropointprotocol.ai/wondercraft/status.json"`
     - `TINYGRAD_STATUS_URL = ""` (unset for now)

2. **Environment Variables**
   - `MOCKS_DISABLED = "1"` enforced
   - Provider upstream URLs configurable for real backend integration
   - Optional authentication tokens for provider APIs
