## ðŸš¨ Risk Assessment

### New Stage 2 Risks
1. **Service deployment delays** - Complex Synthient service implementation
2. **Consensus bypass** - Potential circumvention of dual-consensus governance
3. **SCRA probe delays** - Compliance verification timeline constraints
4. **Evidence automation gaps** - Stage 2 evidence generation complexity

### Current Risk Status
- **Risk Level:** MEDIUM (during implementation)
- **Compliance Status:** STAGE 2 ACTIVATION AUTHORIZED
- **Stage 1 Status:** CLOSED
- **Stage 2 Status:** IN PROGRESS

### Risk Mitigation
- Dual-consensus governance enforcement prevents bypass
- CI/CD gates require evidence and approvals before merge
- SCRA compliance probes scheduled for completion by 2025-09-08
- Automated evidence generation for Stage 2 services

## ðŸ“… Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Due 2025-09-04)
1. **Set environment flags** for Stage 2 services
2. **Create service endpoints** scaffolding
3. **Implement dual-consensus governance** enforcement
4. **Begin SCRA compliance probes**

### Stage 2 Implementation (Due 2025-09-08)
- Deploy Tinygrad trainer service endpoints
- Implement Petals proposal and voting system
- Create Wondercraft asset contribution system
- Establish evidence automation for Stage 2
- Complete SCRA compliance verification

### Post-Stage 2 Actions
- Present Stage 3 proposal to CEO for approval
- Execute Stage 3 implementation upon CEO approval
- Begin advanced Synthient capabilities development
