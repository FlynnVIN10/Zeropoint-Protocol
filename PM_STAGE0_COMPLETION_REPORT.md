| Configure environment flags | ✅ DONE | `MOCKS_DISABLED=1`, `TRAINING_ENABLED=1`, `GOVERNANCE_MODE=dual-consensus` configured in `wrangler.toml` |
| Implement /status/version.json endpoint | ✅ DONE | Endpoint live with required fields: `{phase, commit, ciStatus, buildTime}` |
| Store verification evidence | ✅ DONE | All evidence stored under `/evidence/phase0/verify/{commit}/` |

### SCRA Tasks - ✅ COMPLETED

| Task | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| Probe endpoints | ✅ DONE | All endpoints verified: `/healthz`, `/readyz`, `/status/version.json` |

## Acceptance Criteria - ✅ ALL MET

| Criteria | Status | Verification |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| Build process reads environment flags | ✅ PASS | Environment flags configured in `wrangler.toml` and verified in production |
| /status/version.json endpoint live with required fields | ✅ PASS | Production endpoint returns `{phase: "stage0", commit: "e74f5bc9...", ciStatus: "green", buildTime: "2025-09-02T22:12:07.874Z"}` |
| Mocks disabled in production (MOCKS_DISABLED=1 enforced) | ✅ PASS | Flag verified in production environment configuration |
| UI badges and copy reflect /status/version.json (Truth-to-Repo) | ✅ PASS | Endpoint commit SHA matches repository commit |

## Risk Mitigation - ✅ ALL RESOLVED

| Risk | Status | Mitigation Applied |
|------|--------|-------------------|
| Dev Team fails to enforce MOCKS_DISABLED=1 | ✅ MITIGATED | Flag verified in production environment, evidence collected |
| /status/version.json fields do not align with repo commit | ✅ MITIGATED | All required fields present, commit SHA matches repository |
| Evidence files not populated | ✅ MITIGATED | Comprehensive evidence files created and stored in proper directory structure |
