# Deployment Investigation Directives for Phase 13 Sync

**From**: Project Manager  
**To**: Dev Team Lead  
**CC**: CTO (OCEAN), CEO (Human Consensus)  
**Subject**: Urgent Directives for Cloudflare Pages Deployment Troubleshooting - Execute Investigation & Fixes  
**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Status**: Critical - Immediate Investigation Required; Report Findings  

Dev Team,  

The live website remains unchanged despite builds, indicating deployment failures in Cloudflare Pages. Following CTO directives, perform the following investigation and fixes in the website repo, using the feature branch feature/website-sync-phase13. Aim for resolution, with a fix plan if issues persist. Escalate if dashboard access or token regeneration needed (e.g., for owner).

**General Guidelines**:  
- Use local setup to replicate (clone repo, npm install, build).  
- Document all steps/logs in notes for report.  
- Commit incrementally (e.g., "Investigate: Add workflow logs to report").  
- No interim reportsâ€”only 100% completion (site updated) or roadblocks (e.g., token expiration). Upon completion, commit `/PM-to-Dev-Team/status-reports/deployment_investigation_phase13.md` with findings, log excerpts, manual test results, and action plan. Include curl verifications of updated site (e.g., new title, /features page).  

### **Detailed Directives**  

1. **Inspect GitHub Actions Logs** (Timeline: Immediate)  
   - Pull recent runs of `.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml` from Actions tab on main branch (access via GitHub UI or API if possible).  
   - Identify errors in "Deploy" step (cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3): Look for 401 (invalid token), 404 (wrong ID/project), permission denied.  
   - Copy log excerpts (error messages, exit codes); attach to status report. Note timestamps for correlation.  

2. **Validate Cloudflare Project Configuration** (Timeline: Next 30 Minutes)  
   - **Project Name Match**: Confirm `--project-name` in workflow (`zeropointprotocol-ai`) exactly matches Pages project slug in Cloudflare dashboard (case-sensitive).  
   - **Branch Settings**: Ensure Pages project deploys from main branch.  
   - **Environment Variables**: Verify `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` and `ACCOUNT_ID` secrets in GitHub Settings > Secrets > Actions; check if expired/rotated (compare timestamps). If expired, escalate for regeneration (Pages Edit scope).  

3. **Test a Manual Wrangler Deploy** (Timeline: After Validation)  
   - **Locally**: Install wrangler globally (`npm install -g @cloudflare/wrangler`).  
   - **Run**: `npx docusaurus build` then manual deploy command with temp environment variables (use placeholders or escalate for actual tokens if needed):  
     ```bash
     CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=... \  
     CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=... \  
     wrangler pages deploy build --project-name=zeropointprotocol-ai
     ```  
   - **Observe**: authentication/deployment errors; log full output. This isolates if it's Actions-specific or general Cloudflare issue.  

4. **Clear Cache & Force Redeploy** (Timeline: Parallel)  
   - In Cloudflare dashboard > Pages project > Settings > Caching > Purge everything.  
   - Trigger manual redeploy from dashboard to test.  
   - **Post-actions**: Make a test commit (e.g., comment in index.js) to trigger workflow; monitor Actions run.  

5. **Report Findings & Action Plan** (Timeline: Upon Completion)  
   - **Summarize**: Log excerpts/errors, manual deploy success/fail (details), mismatches (project name, branch, tokens).  
   - **Propose fix**: e.g., Update workflow YAML, regenerate tokens (escalate if needed), correct slug.  
   - **Verify fix**: Curl new title (`curl -s https://zeropointprotocol.ai | grep title`), /features page existence, theme elements.  

Proceed to nail the root cause and get updates live. Escalate for token/dashboard access if blocked.

**PM Status**: Investigation initiated; awaiting findings and resolution.  
**Next Action**: Dev Team to execute; PM to review report and escalate if needed.  

Driving forward to resolve the deploymentâ€”ensuring the Zeropoint Protocol's vision is live! ðŸš€
