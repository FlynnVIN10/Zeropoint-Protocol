## 🚨 **IMMEDIATE VERIFICATION REQUIRED**

### **Check Within 10 Minutes**
1. **GitHub Actions:** `https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/zeropointprotocol.ai/actions`
   - Look for `deploy.yml` workflow execution
   - Verify it's the only workflow running

2. **Cloudflare Dashboard:** 
   - Check Pages section for deployment
   - Verify `zeropointprotocol-ai` project deployment

3. **Live Site:** `https://zeropointprotocol.ai`
   - Check if changes are now visible
   - Verify new aesthetic and functionality

---

## 📞 **ESCALATION PROCEDURES**

### **If Changes Still Don't Appear (Within 15 Minutes)**
1. **Check GitHub Actions Logs** - Look for specific error messages
2. **Verify Cloudflare Secrets** - Ensure API token and account ID are correct
3. **Check Cloudflare Project** - Verify project exists and is configured
4. **Manual Deployment** - Use `wrangler pages publish build` if needed

### **Critical Escalation (Within 30 Minutes)**
- **If no deployment occurs:** Escalate to Cloudflare support
- **If platform issues persist:** Begin alternative platform evaluation
- **If business impact:** Escalate to CEO immediately
