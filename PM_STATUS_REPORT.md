4. **CI/CD conflicts resolved** - Workflow interference eliminated

### Current Risk Status
- **Risk Level:** LOW
- **Compliance Status:** FULLY COMPLIANT
- **Stage 1 Status:** CLOSED
- **Readiness for Stage 2:** APPROVED

### Risk Mitigation
- Automated controls prevent future compliance drift
- CI/CD gates enforce pre-merge validation
- Evidence generation integrated into build process
- SCRA verification completed and documented

## ðŸ“… Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Commit SCRA acknowledgment** to repository
2. **Update PM_STATUS_REPORT.md** with Stage 1 closure status
3. **Verify deployment** and evidence alignment
4. **Prepare Stage 2 directive** upon SCRA sign-off

### Stage 2 Preparation (Upon SCRA Approval)
- Stage 2 implementation planning
- Enhanced training capabilities
- Advanced Synthient integration
- Expanded evidence tree structure
- TDD tests and CI/CD enhancements

### Post-Stage 1 Actions
