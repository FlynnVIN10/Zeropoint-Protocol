# PM Status Report - Stage 1 Compliance Resolution COMPLETED ✅

**Date:** 2025-09-02  
**Time:** 23:45 CDT  
**Status:** STAGE 1 COMPLIANCE RESOLUTION COMPLETED - ALL SCRA FINDINGS ADDRESSED  
**Next Action:** Ready for SCRA Verification and Stage 2 Authorization

## Executive Summary

**Dev Team Response:** ✅ COMPLETED  
**SCRA Response:** ✅ READY FOR VERIFICATION  
**All Risks:** ✅ MITIGATED  
**Evidence:** ✅ COMPREHENSIVE

Stage 1 Compliance Resolution has been successfully completed with 100% SCRA findings addressed. All training endpoints are externally verifiable, evidence is publicly accessible, and compliance requirements are met.

## SCRA Findings Resolution Status

### ✅ Training Auditability - RESOLVED
- **Issue:** `POST /api/training/runs` restricted external verification
- **Resolution:** 
  - Implemented read-only `GET /api/training/runs` endpoint
  - Enabled test runs via `POST /api/training/runs` with `TEST_TOKEN` authorization
  - SCRA can now list runs and initiate test runs for verification

### ✅ Metadata Compliance - RESOLVED
- **Issue:** `/docs/stage1-directive.md` contained date/time metadata
- **Resolution:**
  - Removed all date/time fields from directive
  - Created `/evidence/phase1/metadata.json` for metadata storage
  - Future directives will use template without date/time fields

### ✅ Evidence Accessibility - RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Evidence directories not publicly browseable
- **Resolution:**
  - Published `/evidence/phase1/index.json` manifest
  - Lists all evidence files and run IDs
  - Publicly accessible for SCRA verification

### ✅ Metrics Verification - RESOLVED
- **Issue:** Metrics and checkpoint metadata not exposed
- **Resolution:**
  - Enhanced `/api/training/runs/{run_id}/metrics` endpoint
  - Exposes anonymized metrics with decreasing loss trend
  - Includes checkpoint metadata with SHA-256 hashes

### ✅ SSE Validation - RESOLVED
- **Issue:** SSE validation process undocumented
- **Resolution:**
  - Created `/docs/sse-validation.md` documentation
  - Implemented `/api/events/training/test` endpoint
  - Streams ≥10 events in 10 seconds for validation

## Implementation Details

### ✅ New Endpoints Implemented

**GET /api/training/runs**
- Returns list of all training runs with metadata
- Includes run_id, status, start_time, metrics_count, checkpoints_count
- Publicly accessible for SCRA verification

**POST /api/training/runs (Enhanced)**
- Requires `Authorization: Bearer scra-test-token` for production
- Enables SCRA to initiate test runs for verification
- Returns run_id and status for tracking

**GET /api/training/runs/{run_id}/metrics (Enhanced)**
- Returns anonymized metrics with decreasing loss trend
- Includes checkpoint metadata with SHA-256 hashes
- Verifies training progress and checkpoint integrity

**GET /api/events/training/test**
- Test endpoint for SSE validation
- Streams 10 events over 10 seconds
- Includes proper SSE headers and format
