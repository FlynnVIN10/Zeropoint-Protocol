# Security Documentation

## Overview
Zeropoint Protocol implements comprehensive security measures to protect against threats while maintaining transparency and accountability. Security is built into every layer of the system, from code development to deployment and monitoring.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Layers**: Security controls at every system level
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Secure by default, require explicit permission
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum necessary access and permissions
- **Separation of Concerns**: Isolate security functions from business logic

### 2. Zero Trust Architecture
- **Never Trust, Always Verify**: Authenticate and authorize every request
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time threat detection and response
- **Micro-Segmentation**: Isolate systems and limit lateral movement
- **Identity-Based Access**: Use identity as the security perimeter

### 3. Transparency and Accountability
- **Soulchain Logging**: Immutable audit trail of all security events
- **Public Evidence**: Security posture visible to stakeholders
- **Regular Audits**: Independent security assessments
- **Incident Disclosure**: Transparent reporting of security issues

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors
1. **Web Application Attacks**
   - SQL Injection
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   - Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

2. **Infrastructure Attacks**
   - DDoS attacks
   - Man-in-the-middle attacks
   - DNS hijacking
   - Cloud infrastructure compromise

3. **Social Engineering**
   - Phishing attacks
   - Credential theft
   - Insider threats
   - Supply chain attacks

### Risk Assessment
- **High Risk**: Unauthenticated access to sensitive data
- **Medium Risk**: Denial of service attacks
- **Low Risk**: Information disclosure in public endpoints

## Security Controls

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization
```typescript
// Example: Secure input validation
export const onRequest = async (ctx: any) => {
  try {
    // Validate and sanitize input
    const input = ctx.url.searchParams.get('input');
    if (!input || input.length > 100) {
      return new Response('Invalid input', { status: 400 });
    }
    
    // Sanitize input before processing
    const sanitizedInput = DOMPurify.sanitize(input);
    
    // Process sanitized input
    const result = processInput(sanitizedInput);
    
    return new Response(JSON.stringify(result), {
      headers: {
        "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
        "cache-control": "no-store",
        "x-content-type-options": "nosniff"
      }
    });
  } catch (error) {
    // Log error securely
    console.error('Input processing error:', error.message);
    return new Response('Internal error', { status: 500 });
  }
};
```

### 2. Output Encoding
- **HTML Encoding**: Prevent XSS in HTML output
- **JavaScript Encoding**: Secure JavaScript injection
- **URL Encoding**: Safe URL construction
- **Content Security Policy**: Restrict resource loading

### 3. Authentication and Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Require multiple verification methods
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Granular permission management
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling and timeout

### 4. Data Protection
- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypt sensitive data in storage
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Data Classification**: Categorize data by sensitivity
- **Data Retention**: Implement data lifecycle management

## Security Headers

### Required Headers
All endpoints must return these security headers:

```typescript
const securityHeaders = {
  "content-type": "application/json; charset=utf-8",
  "cache-control": "no-store",
  "x-content-type-options": "nosniff",
  "content-disposition": "inline",
  "access-control-allow-origin": "*"
};
```

### Additional Security Headers
```typescript
const additionalHeaders = {
  "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
  "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
  "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin",
  "Permissions-Policy": "geolocation=(), microphone=()"
