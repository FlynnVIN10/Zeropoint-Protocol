# Deployment Trigger #2

**Date:** August 19, 2025, 03:45 AM CDT  
**Purpose:** Force Cloudflare Pages redeployment after completing all Python build fixes  
**Status:** Ready for deployment  

## What Was Fixed
1. ✅ Added .cfignore to ignore Python files
2. ✅ Updated Cloudflare Pages config to disable Python dependencies
3. ✅ Fixed CI workflow syntax errors
4. ✅ Restored requirements.txt.backup
5. ✅ Removed test_phase2_integration.py from root
6. ✅ All changes committed and pushed

## Expected Result
- Cloudflare Pages build should succeed without Python errors
- API endpoints should become accessible
- Site should show latest commit: c0030dc2
- CI workflows should function with live endpoints

## Current Status
- Main site working but showing old commit
- API endpoints not accessible yet
- Deployment appears stuck or in progress

**Intent:** Good heart, good will, GOD FIRST.
