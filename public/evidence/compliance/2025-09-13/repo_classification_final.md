- âœ… No mock data accessible in production

### Dual-Consensus Governance
- âœ… All changes documented and evidence-based
- âœ… No hardcoded data or random values
- âœ… All endpoints return proper 503 responses when gated
- âœ… Evidence generation automated and complete

## Remediation Actions Taken

1. **API Routes:** Replaced with compliance template
2. **Components:** Added compliance checks
3. **Services:** Added compliance checks
4. **Functions:** Added compliance checks

## Verification Commands

```bash
# Verify no mock files remain
node scripts/complete-codebase-classification.mjs

# Verify MOCKS_DISABLED enforcement
curl -f https://zeropointprotocol.ai/api/readyz

# Run compliance tests
npm run test:compliance
```

## Conclusion

The Zeropoint Protocol codebase is now completely free of mock files and fully compliant
with the MOCKS_DISABLED=1 enforcement requirement. All code paths are either operational
or properly gated behind compliance checks.
