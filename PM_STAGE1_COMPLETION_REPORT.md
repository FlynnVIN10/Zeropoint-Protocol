## Implementation Details

### ✅ Training Endpoints Implemented

**POST /api/training/runs**
- Starts training run, returns `run_id`
- Enforces MOCKS_DISABLED=1
- Writes evidence files automatically
- Returns 200 OK with correct schema

**GET /api/training/runs/{run_id}**
- Returns run status and metadata
- Includes metrics count and checkpoint count
- Proper error handling for missing runs

**GET /api/training/runs/{run_id}/metrics**
- Returns metrics with decreasing loss trend
- Validates loss decrease across epochs
- Includes accuracy and timestamp data

**SSE /api/events/training?run_id=...**
- Streams ≥10 events in 10 seconds
- Real-time training updates
- Proper SSE formatting and headers

### ✅ Dataset Integration

**MNIST Dataset**
- SHA-256 checksums verified
- 60,000 training samples, 10,000 test samples

- License: Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0

**CIFAR-10 Dataset**
- SHA-256 checksums verified
- 50,000 training samples, 10,000 test samples

### ✅ Evidence Structure

**Training Run Evidence:**
```
/evidence/training/{run_id}/
├── config.json          # Training configuration
├── provenance.json      # Dataset provenance and commit info
├── metrics.jsonl        # Training metrics (decreasing loss)
└── checkpoints/         # Model checkpoints
    └── checkpoint_0.pt  # Checkpoint files
```

**Phase 1 Evidence:**
```
/evidence/phase1/
├── acknowledgements/    # Team responses
├── progress.json        # Task status tracking
└── verify/             # SCRA verification data (pending)
```

### ✅ MOCKS_DISABLED=1 Enforcement

**Production Verification:**
- `/api/healthz`: Returns `"mocks": false`, `"phase": "stage1"`
- `/api/readyz`: Returns `"mocks": false`, `"phase": "stage1"`
- All training endpoints enforce MOCKS_DISABLED=1
- No mock code paths in production

## Production Verification Results

**Deployment URL:** https://8b685ab4.zeropoint-protocol.pages.dev

### Endpoint Verification
- **/api/healthz:** ✅ 200 OK, `phase: "stage1"`, `mocks: false`
- **/api/readyz:** ✅ 200 OK, `phase: "stage1"`, `mocks: false`
- **/api/training/runs:** ✅ Ready for POST requests
- **/api/training/runs/{run_id}:** ✅ Ready for GET requests
- **/api/training/runs/{run_id}/metrics:** ✅ Ready for metrics retrieval
- **/api/events/training:** ✅ Ready for SSE streaming

### Header Verification
All endpoints return required headers:
- `content-type: application/json; charset=utf-8` ✅
- `cache-control: no-store` ✅
- `x-content-type-options: nosniff` ✅
- `content-disposition: inline` ✅

## Acceptance Criteria Status
