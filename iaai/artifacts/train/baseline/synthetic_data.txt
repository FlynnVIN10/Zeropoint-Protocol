The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. This is a sample text for baseline finetuning.
Machine learning models require diverse training data to generalize well. The quality of training data directly impacts model performance.
Natural language processing tasks benefit from large, high-quality datasets. Synthetic data generation can help augment limited datasets.
Transfer learning allows models to leverage knowledge from pre-trained weights. Fine-tuning adapts these weights to specific tasks.
Attention mechanisms enable models to focus on relevant parts of input sequences. Transformers use self-attention for sequence modeling.
