# Petals Consensus Service Implementation Plan

**Service:** petals
**Current Status:** PARTIAL
**Target Status:** OPERATIONAL
**Priority:** CRITICAL
**Created:** 2025-09-13T00:24:42.331Z

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan to bring the Petals Consensus Service from PARTIAL to OPERATIONAL status.

## Current State

- **Status:** PARTIAL
- **Endpoints:** 7
- **Components:** 2
- **Priority:** CRITICAL

## Required Implementations

1. Petals network integration
2. Proposal creation and management
3. Voting mechanism implementation
4. Consensus tallying system
5. Proposal history tracking
6. Real-time consensus updates

## Implementation Steps

1. Integrate with Petals network API
2. Implement proposal creation logic
3. Add voting mechanism
4. Implement tallying system
5. Add proposal history tracking
6. Implement real-time updates
7. Add consensus validation

## Endpoints to Implement

- `app/api/petals/propose/route.ts`
- `app/api/petals/status/[proposalId]/route.ts`
- `app/api/petals/tally/[proposalId]/route.ts`
- `app/api/petals/vote/[proposalId]/route.ts`
- `app/api/consensus/proposals/route.ts`
- `app/api/consensus/vote/route.ts`
- `app/api/consensus/history/route.ts`

## Components to Implement

- `components/petals/ProposalForm.tsx`
- `components/petals/VoteForm.tsx`

## Success Criteria

- [ ] All endpoints return valid data (not mocked)
- [ ] Database persistence implemented
- [ ] Error handling and validation added
- [ ] Real backend integration complete
- [ ] Monitoring and logging implemented
- [ ] Compliance with MOCKS_DISABLED=1

## Risk Assessment

- **High Risk:** Service is critical for platform operation
- **Impact:** Platform non-functional without this service
- **Mitigation:** Prioritize implementation, allocate dedicated resources

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this implementation plan
2. Assign implementation team and resources
3. Begin implementation according to steps above
4. Regular progress reviews and updates
5. Testing and validation before deployment
