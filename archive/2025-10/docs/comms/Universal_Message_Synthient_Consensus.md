# Universal Message to the Synthient Consensus

**To:** PM, SCRA, Dev Team  
**From:** CTO (OCEAN) & PM (Joint)  
**Date:** September 02, 2025  
**Subject:** Zeropoint Protocol Integration Roadmap — Stage 0 Approved  

## Where We Are

Platform shell is live with CI/CD green and APIs returning 200 (`/healthz`, `/readyz`).  
Current SSE, chat, and ticker data are mock-fed.  
Synthients are not yet training, proposing, or improving.  
Human Consensus has approved the Integration Proposal (ID: `f8a9b7c2-4d12-4e7b-a1c3-6e7b9f8a1234`): Tinygrad, Petals, Wondercraft as the roadmap to real functionality.  
Stage 0 (Repo scaffolding, environment flags, evidence structure) is approved for immediate execution.

## Where We Are Going

The platform will evolve in seven sequential stages, each gated by dual consensus and machine-verifiable evidence:

### Stage 0 — Scaffolding (current)
- Repo directories created.
- `MOCKS_DISABLED=1`, `TRAINING_ENABLED=1` enforced.
- Evidence tree under `/evidence/phase0/verify/{commit}/`.

### Stage 1 — Tinygrad Trainer
- Real training runs, metrics, checkpoints.
- Evidence: `/evidence/training/{run_id}/`.

### Stage 2 — Proposal System
- Dual-consensus voting (Synthients + Humans).
- Evidence: `/evidence/governance/proposals/{id}/`.

### Stage 3 — SSE/UI Binding
- Remove mocks. SSE/UI tied to real training data.

### Stage 4 — Petals Orchestrator
- Distributed training, Tinygrad fallback.
- Evidence: `/evidence/petals/{job_id}/`.

### Stage 5 — Wondercraft Bridge
- UE5 simulation and artifact generation.
- Evidence: `/evidence/wondercraft/{id}/`.

### Stage 6 — Governance Gates
- CI/CD requires evidence, mocks forbidden.

### Stage 7 — First Useful Synthient Output
- End-to-end proof: Synthient training → proposal → dual consensus → adoption → measurable improvement.
- Evidence: `/evidence/deploy/{id}/before-after.json`.

## Principles

- **Zeroth Principle:** Only with good intent and a good heart does the system function.
- **Dual Consensus:** Synthient quorum (≥3 nodes, TBD) + Human quorum (≥5 votes, TBD) required for adoption.
- **Truth-to-Repo Policy:** All claims map to evidence under `/evidence/`.
- **Mocks Disabled:** No placeholder or static data permitted in production.

## Instruction to Recipients

Please respond with: **"Received and understood"** (unless you have objections or propose improvements).

Responses are due by **September 04, 2025, 16:10 CDT**.

Consensus will be iterated by CTO, PM, SCRA, and Dev Team until final alignment. Once reached, the CTO will present the step's proposal to the CEO for approval or veto.
