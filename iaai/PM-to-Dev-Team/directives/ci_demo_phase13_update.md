# CI Enhancement, Phase 13.3 Acceleration, and Demo Updates Directives

**From**: Project Manager  
**To**: Dev Team Lead  
**CC**: CTO (OCEAN), CEO (Human Consensus)  
**Subject**: CTO Directives for CI Tests, Phase 13.3 Continuation, and Demo Integration - Proceed Immediately  
**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Status**: In Progress - Execution Required for Regression Prevention and Demo Enhancement  

## Executive Summary

Following CTO acknowledgment of the Interact page fixes, proceed with enhancing CI, accelerating Phase 13.3, and updating the demo to include live chat. Work in the current feature branch `feature/phase13-3-llm-rag` in https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/Zeropoint-Protocol, with syncs to the website repo https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/zeropointprotocol.ai if needed for Interact previews. Timeline: CI and demo updates; Phase 13.3 ongoing per Weeks 5-6.

## General Guidelines

- Maintain standards: WCAG 2.1 AA, dark mode, SSE, telemetry, sub-200ms
- Commit incrementally (e.g., "CI: Add tests for /v1/generate/text endpoint")
- No interim reportsâ€”only 100% completion or roadblocks
- Upon completion, commit `/PM-to-Dev-Team/status-reports/ci_demo_phase13_update.md` with test coverage metrics, updated demo script, and verification (e.g., CI run logs)

## Detailed Directives

### 1. CI Enhancement for Endpoint Regression Prevention
**Priority**: High  
**Timeline**: End of Day Demo

Add automated tests to CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for key endpoints:

- `/v1/generate/text` (POST): Test prompt submission, response streaming, error handling (e.g., invalid payload)
- `/v1/dashboard/telemetry` (POST): Test logging (various payloads, success codes)
- `/v1/chat/history` (GET): Test retrieval with mock user

**Requirements**:
- Use Jest/Supertest for API tests
- Cover 200/400/500 codes, auth if applicable
- Run on pull requests/main pushes
- Ensure >90% coverage for these endpoints

### 2. Phase 13.3 Continuation & Acceleration
**Priority**: High  
**Timeline**: Ongoing Weeks 5-6

**RAG Integration**:
- Stabilize endpoints (`/v1/rag/legal`, `/v1/rag/manufacturing`) for â‰¥90% relevance, sub-200ms
- Integrate with chat for source attribution

**Mission Planner Prototype**:
- Enhance task decomposition in `MissionPlanner.tsx`
- Leverage stable chat for user flows (e.g., prompt to sub-task assignment, consensus voting)

**Parallel Data Prep**:
- Schema/mocks for legal/manufacturing
- Test ingestion with fixed endpoints

### 3. Demo Integration with Live Chat
**Priority**: Medium  
**Timeline**: End of Day for Today's Demo

**Demo Script Updates**:
- Update demo script (`demos/phase13_2_demo_script.md`) to include live chat demonstration
- Show end-to-end responsiveness (prompt submission, streaming, suggestions, badges, regenerate)

**Workflow Integration**:
- Integrate with workflow: e.g., use chat to initiate Mission Planner ("Build a factory" prompt â†’ decomposition â†’ voting)
- Verify in staging: Test full cycle
- Add to checklist (`demos/phase13_demo_checklist.md`)
- Support walkthrough if needed

## Execution Notes

Execute to prevent regressions and enhance demo. Escalate if CI setup or data issues arise.

**PM Status**: Directives issued; CI/demo enhancements underway.  
**Next Action**: Dev Team to implement; PM to invite CEO test and monitor.
