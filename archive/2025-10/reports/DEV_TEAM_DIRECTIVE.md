# Dev Team Directive: Repository Remediation and Operational Readiness

**Issued:** 2025-09-13T00:15:00Z  
**Authority:** CTO Directive Execution  
**Priority:** CRITICAL - Immediate Action Required  
**Status:** Active

## Context

Following the comprehensive repository audit per CTO directive, critical findings have been identified that prevent the Zeropoint Protocol from achieving operational readiness for Synthient training and contributions. This directive outlines the required remediation steps to restore compliance with dual-consensus governance principles.

## Current State Summary

- **Repository Files Analyzed:** 196
- **Mock Files Identified:** 32 (16.3% of codebase)
- **Non-Functional Services:** 2 (ML Pipeline, Quantum Compute)
- **Partially Functional Services:** 3 (Tinygrad 40%, Petals 50%, Wondercraft 57%)
- **Critical Compliance Violations:** Multiple

## Required Actions

### 1. Catalogue and Annotate All Files

**Objective:** Complete the repository audit by ensuring every file is properly classified and annotated.

**Tasks:**
- Review all files under `/`, `app/`, `services/`, and `scripts/` directories
- Classify each file as one of:
  - **Operational:** Connected to real backend services, fully functional
  - **Gated Prototype:** Returns 503 when MOCKS_DISABLED=1, has compliance checks
  - **Mock/Stub:** Contains hardcoded data, random values, or in-memory storage
  - **Deprecated:** No longer maintained, should be removed
- Add file-level annotations indicating operational state and gating logic
- Update the repository audit report with any newly discovered files

**Evidence Required:** Updated audit report with 100% file coverage

### 2. Remove or Gate Mock Implementations

**Objective:** Eliminate all mock data and ensure proper compliance with MOCKS_DISABLED=1 enforcement.

**Tasks:**
- For the 32 identified mock files and any others discovered:
  - Replace mock logic with proper backend integrations, OR
  - Implement proper 503 Service Unavailable responses when MOCKS_DISABLED=1
- Focus on critical endpoints:
  - Training metrics (`/api/training/metrics`)
  - AI reasoning (`/api/ai/reasoning`)
  - AI models (`/api/ai/models`)
  - ML pipeline (`/api/ml/pipeline`)
  - Quantum compute (`/api/quantum/compute`)
- Ensure all mock endpoints return consistent error responses with proper headers
- Remove all hardcoded data, random value generation, and in-memory storage

**Evidence Required:** Verification that all mock endpoints return 503 when MOCKS_DISABLED=1

### 3. Implement Persistent Storage

**Objective:** Migrate from temporary storage to durable database layer for all data persistence.

**Tasks:**
- Replace in-memory storage with database connections
- Implement persistent storage for:
  - Training runs and metrics
  - Consensus proposals and voting records
  - Audit logs and system events
  - ML pipeline configurations and results
  - User sessions and authentication data
- Remove reliance on global variables and local maps
- Ensure data survives application restarts
- Implement proper database schema and migrations

**Evidence Required:** All data persistence verified through database connections

### 4. Enable Real Back-End Integrations

**Objective:** Connect all services to their intended backends or properly gate non-functional services.

**Tasks:**
- **Tinygrad Service:** Connect to actual Tinygrad training infrastructure
- **Petals Service:** Integrate with real Petals consensus network
- **Wondercraft Service:** Connect to actual contribution and asset management systems
- **ML Pipeline Service:** Either integrate real ML services or mark as prototype and remove from production
- **Quantum Compute Service:** Either integrate real quantum services or mark as prototype and remove from production
- Ensure all integrations include proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- Implement service health checks and monitoring

**Evidence Required:** All services connected to real backends or properly gated

### 5. Update Feature Flags

**Objective:** Ensure MOCKS_DISABLED defaults to true in production and add CI verification.

**Tasks:**
- Verify MOCKS_DISABLED=1 in all production environments
- Add CI checks to verify no mock logic is reachable when flag is enabled
- Implement automated testing for compliance behavior
- Ensure feature flags are properly propagated to all environments
- Add validation to prevent mock code from being deployed to production

**Evidence Required:** CI pipeline validates MOCKS_DISABLED enforcement

### 6. Document Service Readiness

**Objective:** Maintain comprehensive documentation of service status and requirements.

**Tasks:**
- Update service status documents in `/public/evidence/research/service_status/`
- Document readiness level for each service
- List known gaps and required actions for full operational status
- Maintain service architecture documentation
- Create API specifications for all operational endpoints
- Document integration points and dependencies

**Evidence Required:** Complete service documentation with readiness assessments

### 7. Expand Test Coverage

**Objective:** Implement comprehensive testing to verify compliance and functionality.

**Tasks:**
- Add unit tests for all API endpoints
- Implement integration tests for service interactions
- Create compliance tests that verify:
  - Mock endpoints return 503 when MOCKS_DISABLED=1
  - Operational endpoints return valid data
  - Error handling works correctly
  - Database connections are functional
- Add performance tests for critical paths
- Implement automated test execution in CI pipeline

**Evidence Required:** Test coverage report showing compliance verification

### 8. Maintain Live Risk Register

**Objective:** Keep risk tracking current and ensure proper escalation procedures.

**Tasks:**
- Update risk register with any newly identified issues
- Assign severity levels and owners to all risks
- Document remediation paths and evidence links
- Escalate high-severity issues promptly
- Maintain traceability between risks and evidence
- Regular risk register reviews and updates

**Evidence Required:** Updated risk register with current status and evidence links

## Compliance Requirements

### Dual-Consensus Governance
- All changes must be verifiable and evidence-based
- No mock data in production environments
- All claims must match actual system behavior
- Maintain audit trail for all modifications

### Evidence Standards
- All evidence must be stored in `/public/evidence/` directory
- Evidence must be accessible and verifiable
- Maintain evidence index for easy navigation
- Link evidence to specific risks and remediation actions

### Quality Gates
- No merges allowed while critical risks remain unresolved
- All new files must have status annotations
- CI must validate compliance before deployment
- All services must meet readiness thresholds

## Success Criteria

The Dev Team will have successfully completed this directive when:

1. **100% File Classification:** All repository files are properly classified and annotated
2. **Zero Mock Violations:** No mock data accessible when MOCKS_DISABLED=1
3. **Persistent Storage:** All data stored in durable database layer
4. **Real Integrations:** All services connected to actual backends or properly gated
5. **Feature Flag Compliance:** MOCKS_DISABLED properly enforced in all environments
6. **Complete Documentation:** All services documented with readiness status
7. **Comprehensive Testing:** Full test coverage with compliance verification
8. **Live Risk Management:** Risk register current with proper escalation

## Escalation Procedures

- **P0 (Critical) Issues:** Escalate to CEO and CTO immediately
- **P1 (High) Issues:** Escalate to CTO within 4 hours
- **P2 (Medium) Issues:** Escalate to PM within 24 hours
- **P3 (Low) Issues:** Track in backlog for next sprint

## Resources and Support

- **Evidence Directory:** `/public/evidence/`
- **Service Documentation:** `/public/evidence/research/service_status/`
- **Risk Register:** `/public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/risk_register.md`
- **Repository Audit:** `/public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/repo_audit.md`

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Review this directive and current risk register
2. **Short-term:** Begin with mock file remediation (highest priority)
3. **Medium-term:** Implement persistent storage and real integrations
4. **Long-term:** Complete testing and documentation

**This directive is effective immediately and remains active until all success criteria are met.**
