# CTO Directives — 2025-08-14
Intent: "GOD FIRST, with good intent and a good heart."

## D-006 — README ↔ Repo Tree Parity
Goals: Eliminate mismatch between README and actual tree.  
Root Cause: README lists `/src`; repo has `app/`, `components/`, `iaai/`.  
Outcomes: README reflects real layout or `/src` restored.

Milestones:
1) Audit current tree and document in README.  
2) Restore `/src` if code exists elsewhere; else update README to current layout.  
3) Add CI parity job comparing README "Structure" with `git ls-tree`.

Acceptance:
- README "Structure" equals current tree.  
- CI job `parity:readme-tree` passes.

## D-007 — `/status` Page Truthfulness
Goals: Show only verified telemetry.  
Root Cause: Unverified labels on `/status`.  
Outcomes: `/status` uses `/api/healthz` and `/api/readyz` only.

Milestones:
1) Remove static/unverified service labels.  
2) Render commit SHA and build time from `/api/healthz`.  
3) Add per-service checks before display; hide until verified.  
4) Add e2e test to fail on unverified strings.

Acceptance:
- `/status` contains only verified values.  
- e2e `status:verified-only` passes.

## D-008 — `/docs` and `/library` Content Alignment
Goals: Serve real docs; no homepage duplication.  
Root Cause: Routes show marketing block.  
Outcomes: Real content or links hidden.

Milestones:
1) Inventory docs/library content.  
2) Populate routes with real content.  
3) Hide nav links if empty.  
4) CI link-check fails on placeholders.

Acceptance:
- Routes return valid content or are hidden.  
- CI `links:public-routes` passes.

## D-009 — Governance PR Merge & Enforcement
Goals: Land governance hard-lock and protections.  
Root Cause: PR #42 open pending merge.  
Outcomes: Governance files merged; protections active.

Milestones:
1) After dual consensus, merge PR #42.  
2) Enable branch protections: CODEOWNERS review, required checks, signed commits, dismiss stale approvals.  
3) Verify README banner and `/GOVERNANCE.md` live.

Acceptance:
- `/.github/CODEOWNERS` enforced on all files.  
- Required checks pass: tests, parity, links, Lighthouse A11y ≥95, `/api/healthz` and `/api/readyz` 200.

### Standing Rule SR-001 — Verification cadence
- Scan repo+site when CTO requests status.  
- Scan immediately after "done," then approve or veto with evidence.  
- On veto, issue precise fixes with root cause.
