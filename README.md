# Zeropoint Protocol - Agentic Consensus Platform

Zeropoint Protocol is an advanced AI system that combines distributed machine learning, ethical AI governance, and decentralized identity management. It is designed to facilitate agentic consensus through a dual-architecture system featuring a Python backend for AI model inference and a NestJS API gateway for orchestration and security. This repository contains the core platform, distinct from the corporate website hosted at [https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/zeropointprotocol.ai](https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/zeropointprotocol.ai).

## üåü Overview

**Zeroth Principle**: Only with good intent and a good heart does the system function.

The platform integrates:
- Distributed text and image generation using Petals and Stable Diffusion.
- Ethical AI governance via Zeroth-gate compliance.
- Decentralized file storage and content addressing with IPFS.
- Soulchain for intent validation and ethical compliance.
- Monitoring with Prometheus metrics and health checks.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components
- **AI Backend (Python)**: Distributed text and image generation.
- **API Gateway (NestJS)**: RESTful API with JWT authentication and rate limiting.
- **IPFS Integration**: Decentralized storage.
- **Soulchain**: Ethical governance and intent validation.
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus metrics and health checks.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+
- Docker (optional)
- Git

### Local Development Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/Zeropoint-Protocol.git
   cd Zeropoint-Protocol
   ```
2. Start Python AI Backend:
   ```bash
   cd Zeropoint
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   python app_simple.py
   ```
   AI service available at `http://localhost:8000`.
3. Start NestJS API Gateway:
   ```bash
   cd ..
   npm install
   export JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
   export JWT_EXPIRES_IN="24h"
   export NODE_ENV="development"
   npm run start
   ```
   API gateway available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üì° API Endpoints

### Health & Status
- `GET /v1/health`: Service health check.
- `GET /v1/status`: System status and metrics.
