**Date:** 2025-08-10  
**Directive:** Fourth Sub-Phase: Prod Verification – No Dashboard Required  
**Status:** IN PROGRESS  
**Owner:** Dev Team  
**Due Date:** EOD  

## Executive Summary

Implementation of production verification workflows and CTO verification gate to ensure production environment is green and compliant across both pages.dev and custom domain.

## Previous Directives Status

### Third Sub-Phase: Synthiants Must Do Real Work - ✅ COMPLETED
- **Bot Identity:** ✅ Complete - Bot configured with least privilege access
- **Autonomy Pipeline:** ✅ Complete - Pipeline E2E tested and operational
- **Dual-Consensus Wire-up:** ✅ Complete - Consensus mechanism implemented
- **Proof Task:** ✅ Complete - ≥1 PR merged with dual-consensus enforced

## Current Directive: Prod Verification – No Dashboard Required

### Epic: Prod Green Demonstration
- **Goals:** Verify-Prod + CTO Gate both PASS on pages.dev and custom domain
- **Root Cause:** Manual CF access delay resolved by automation

## Task Status

### 1. Run Workflows (Owner: DevOps, Estimate: 1h, Due: EOD)
- **Status:** 🔄 IN PROGRESS
- **Owner:** DevOps Team
- **Issue:** #6 (GitHub issue created)
- **Progress:** Workflows created and committed
- **Acceptance Criteria:** Workflows PASS; logs/smoke outputs attached; security: Use least-privilege tokens (GH Secrets); ethics: N/A (verification only)
- **Dependencies:** None
- **Risks:** Host flake (mitigation: Retry logic in workflow, owner: DevOps, ETA: 15m; rollback: Re-run previous successful Gate)

### 2. Acceptance Checks (Owner: QA, Estimate: 1h, Due: EOD)
- **Status:** ⏳ PENDING
- **Owner:** QA Team
- **Issue:** #7 (GitHub issue created)
- **Progress:** Waiting for Task 1 completion
- **Acceptance Criteria:** No errors; APIs healthy (/healthz, /readyz 200); scores ≥80; E2E tests if applicable
- **Dependencies:** Task 1
- **Risks:** Test failures (mitigation: Comprehensive test suite, owner: QA, ETA: 30m; rollback: Re-run tests with previous configuration)

## Dependencies & Critical Path

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Host flake** - Mitigation: Retry logic in workflow, owner: DevOps, ETA: 15m; rollback: Re-run previous successful Gate
- **Test failures** - Mitigation: Comprehensive test suite, owner: QA, ETA: 30m; rollback: Re-run tests with previous configuration

### Medium Risk
- **Workflow execution delays** - Mitigation: Automated scheduling, owner: DevOps, ETA: 1h; rollback: Manual workflow execution

## Progress Metrics

- **Tasks Completed:** 0/2
- **Critical Path:** 0% complete
- **Overall Progress:** 0%
- **Time Remaining:** EOD

## Next Actions

1. **Immediate (Next 1 hour):** Execute Verify-Prod workflow
2. **Today:** Complete CTO Verification Gate
3. **EOD:** Report completion to PM with run URLs and evidence artifacts

## Blockers & Escalations

- **None currently identified**
- **Escalation threshold:** >30 minutes
- **Escalation format:** 5-line summary (root cause, impact, owner, ETA, rollback)

## Quality Gates

- **TDD compliance:** Tests first for all features
- **CI/CD enforcement:** All changes via PR with linked issues
- **Security review:** Threat model + harms checklist in PR descriptions
- **Ethics review:** Decision transparency and safety measures

## CTO Verification Gate

- **Status:** PENDING
- **Trigger:** Post-updates completion
- **Criteria:** All tasks completed, production verified, audit trail complete

## Workflow URLs

- **Verify-Prod:** Available in GitHub Actions
- **CTO Verification Gate:** Available in GitHub Actions
- **Manual Trigger:** Both workflows support manual execution
