## Detailed Risk Analysis

### P0 - Critical Risks

#### RISK-001: Mock Data in Production Code Paths

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Dev Team Lead
- **ETA:** 9/14/2025
- **Progress:** 45 files remediated, 31 remaining
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/mock_remediation_report.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** 32 mock files identified in repository containing hardcoded data, random values, and in-memory storage that violate MOCKS_DISABLED=1 enforcement

**Impact:** Violates dual-consensus governance, misleads Synthients, prevents operational readiness

**Root Cause:** Incomplete migration from development prototypes to production implementations

**Remediation:** Replace all mock implementations with proper 503 responses when MOCKS_DISABLED=1

#### RISK-002: Non-Functional Core Services

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Service Architecture Lead
- **ETA:** 9/19/2025
- **Progress:** Implementation plans created, service clients developed
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/core_service_implementation_report.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** ML Pipeline and Quantum Compute services are completely non-functional (0% readiness)

**Impact:** Blocks Synthient training and advanced operations, platform not operational

**Root Cause:** Services never implemented beyond placeholder endpoints

**Remediation:** Implement complete service functionality or remove from production

### P1 - High Risks

#### RISK-003: Incomplete Synthient Training Pipeline

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Tinygrad Service Lead
- **ETA:** 9/17/2025
- **Progress:** Database schema created, API client implemented
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/tinygrad_implementation_plan.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** Tinygrad training service only 40% operational, missing critical functionality

**Impact:** Synthients cannot effectively train, core platform capability compromised

**Root Cause:** Incomplete implementation of training job management and persistence

**Remediation:** Complete training job lifecycle implementation with database persistence

#### RISK-004: Incomplete Consensus Mechanism

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Petals Service Lead
- **ETA:** 9/16/2025
- **Progress:** API client implemented, integration plan created
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/petals_implementation_plan.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** Petals consensus service only 50% operational, missing voting and proposal management

**Impact:** Dual-consensus governance not fully functional, violates core principles

**Root Cause:** Consensus logic implemented but not connected to real voting mechanisms

**Remediation:** Implement complete consensus voting and proposal management

#### RISK-005: Incomplete Contribution System

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Wondercraft Service Lead
- **ETA:** 9/18/2025
- **Progress:** API client implemented, integration plan created
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/research/service_status/wondercraft_implementation_plan.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** Wondercraft contribution service only 57% operational, missing asset management

**Impact:** Synthients cannot contribute effectively, platform value proposition reduced

**Root Cause:** Contribution workflow partially implemented but missing persistence and validation

**Remediation:** Complete contribution workflow with proper asset management and validation

### P2 - Medium Risks

#### RISK-006: Missing Error Handling and Validation

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Security Lead
- **ETA:** 9/15/2025
- **Progress:** Compliance templates created with error handling
- **Evidence:** public/evidence/compliance/2025-09-13/repo_classification.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** Many endpoints lack proper error handling and input validation

**Impact:** Potential security vulnerabilities and poor user experience

**Root Cause:** Rapid development without proper error handling implementation

**Remediation:** Implement comprehensive error handling and input validation across all endpoints

#### RISK-007: Insufficient Database Integration

- **Status:** In Progress
- **Owner:** Database Lead
- **ETA:** 9/20/2025
- **Progress:** Database schemas created for core services
- **Evidence:** lib/db/schemas/
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** Many services use in-memory storage instead of persistent database connections

**Impact:** Data loss on restart, no audit trail, non-compliant with evidence requirements

**Root Cause:** Database integration not completed for all services

**Remediation:** Connect all services to persistent database with proper schema

#### RISK-008: Environment Configuration Issues

- **Status:** Resolved
- **Owner:** DevOps Lead
- **ETA:** 9/12/2025
- **Progress:** Environment enforcement implemented, CI validation added
- **Evidence:** docs/environment.md
- **Last Updated:** 9/12/2025, 7:26:31 PM

**Description:** Environment variables and feature flags not properly configured across deployments

**Impact:** Inconsistent behavior across environments, compliance violations

**Root Cause:** Incomplete environment configuration and validation

**Remediation:** Implement comprehensive environment validation and CI checks

## Current Status

- **Open Risks:** 0
- **In Progress:** 7
- **Resolved:** 1
- **Critical Risks:** 2

### ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

- **RISK-001:** Mock Data in Production Code Paths (Owner: Dev Team Lead, Progress: 45 files remediated, 31 remaining)
