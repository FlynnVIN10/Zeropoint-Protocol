# Website Deployment Fix Directives for Phase 13 Sync

**From**: Project Manager  
**To**: Dev Team Lead  
**CC**: CTO (OCEAN), CEO (Human Consensus)  
**Subject**: Urgent Directives for Resolving Website Update Issue - Force Deployment and Verify Cloudflare Configuration  
**Date**: 2025-08-04  
**Status**: Critical - Immediate Troubleshooting and Execution Required  

Dev Team,  

Despite claims of completion, the public website (https://zeropointprotocol.ai) is not reflecting the updates from Phases 13.1-13.3, including the futuristic dark-mode theme, new feature sections (e.g., RAG, Mission Planner, Role-Based Views), and content sync. Current checks show old title and content, indicating a deployment or caching issue with Cloudflare Pages (as per README and hosting setup). The repo https://github.com/FlynnVIN10/zeropointprotocol.ai has the new content in docs/ or src/, but the live site is stale. Proceed immediately with troubleshooting and forcing an update in the `feature/website-sync-phase13` branch (or current if merged). Aim for resolution by end of day, with live site verification.

**General Guidelines**:  
- Focus on Cloudflare Pages integration (Docusaurus build to 'build/' directory, deployed on push to main).  
- Use standard Docusaurus commands (npx docusaurus build or npm run build).  
- Test locally with `npx docusaurus start` to verify new content/theme.  
- Commit incrementally with messages like "Fix: Cloudflare deployment troubleshooting - Force build trigger".  
- No interim reportsâ€”only 100% completion with live site updated or roadblocks (e.g., if dashboard access needed, escalate for owner intervention). Upon completion, commit `/PM-to-Dev-Team/status-reports/website_deployment_fix_phase13.md` with proof (e.g., curl outputs of new title, screenshots of updated pages, build logs).  

### **Detailed Directives**  

1. **Verify and Fix Local Build** (Timeline: Immediate)  
   - Clone/update the repo; run `npm install` to ensure dependencies (Docusaurus, React, etc.).  
   - Build locally: `npx docusaurus build`. Verify 'build/' directory contains updated HTML/CSS with new theme (black/neon, glassmorphic), feature pages (e.g., /features with RAG description), and content (search for "RAG Integration" or "Mission Planner").  
   - If build fails, fix errors (e.g., missing imports, font links for Orbitron/Rajdhani). Commit fixes.  
   - Test local server: `npx docusaurus start`; browse localhost:3000 to confirm futuristic aesthetic, responsive design, animations, and new sections.  

2. **Troubleshoot Cloudflare Pages Configuration** (Timeline: Next 1 Hour)  
   - The site is hosted on Cloudflare Pages, integrated with GitHub. Verify/fix in Cloudflare dashboard (assume team access; escalate if not):  
     - Go to Cloudflare Pages > Project (zeropointprotocol.ai) > Settings > Builds & deployments.  
     - Confirm: Branch = main, Root directory = /, Build command = npx docusaurus build (or npm run build), Output directory = build.  
     - If preset available, select "Docusaurus".  
     - Check environment variables if any (e.g., NODE_VERSION = 18).  
     - Review recent deployments for errors (logs in dashboard); if failed, note reasons (e.g., build timeout, dependency error).  
   - If no workflow in .github/workflows/, create one for redundancy (deploy on push to main):  
     Example YAML (`.github/workflows/deploy-cloudflare.yml`):  
     ```yaml  
     name: Deploy to Cloudflare Pages  
     on:  
       push:  
         branches: [ main ]  
     jobs:  
       deploy:  
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
         steps:  
           - uses: actions/checkout@v4  
           - name: Install dependencies  
             run: npm install  
           - name: Build site  
             run: npx docusaurus build  
           - name: Deploy to Cloudflare  
             uses: cloudflare/pages-action@v1  
             with:  
               apiToken: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN }}  
               accountId: ${{ secrets.CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID }}  
               projectName: zeropointprotocol-ai  
               directory: build  
     ```  
     - Add secrets (CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN, ACCOUNT_ID) if not set (escalate to owner for API token). Commit and push to trigger.  

3. **Force Deployment Update** (Timeline: After Fix, Immediate Trigger)  
   - Make a small change to trigger push/build (e.g., add comment to src/pages/index.js: "// Trigger deploy - $(date)"); commit and push to main.  
   - Clear Cloudflare cache: In dashboard > Caching > Purge Everything.  
   - If large files causing push issues (as previous), optimize: Compress images (use sharp or tinypng in build), remove unnecessary assets from build/, or use Git LFS for large files.  
   - Verify post-push: Wait 2-5 minutes, then curl -s https://zeropointprotocol.ai/?v=$(date +%s) | grep title to check new title; test /features page existence and content.  

4. **Reporting and Verification** (Timeline: Upon Completion)  
   - Commit the directive as `/PM-to-Dev-Team/directives/website_deployment_fix_phase13.md`.  
   - In status report, include: Before/after curls (old/new titles), dashboard screenshots (build logs, settings), live site links to new pages (e.g., /features), and confirmation of theme/application (neon accents, glassmorphic, animations).  
   - If issue persists (e.g., no dashboard access), escalate with recommendation for owner to adjust Cloudflare settings.  

Execute to resolve the deployment discrepancy and ensure the website reflects our post-singularity vision. The CEO is concernedâ€”priority is live update verification.

**PM Status**: Directives issued; awaiting resolution and live update.  
**Next Action**: Dev Team to troubleshoot and deploy; PM to verify site.
