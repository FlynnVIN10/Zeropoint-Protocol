# Cloudflare Pages Deployment Instructions - Immediate Execution Required

**Priority:** CRITICAL - Execute immediately per CEO directive
**Deadline:** Complete within 2 hours of receipt
**Impact:** Unblocks Proposal Gate advancement

## Executive Summary

The Zeropoint Protocol has completed all technical implementation tasks. The only remaining blocker is Cloudflare Pages deployment with the canonical commit `1604e587`. Execute these instructions immediately to complete the deployment alignment.

## Required Environment Variables (Cloudflare Pages Dashboard)

Navigate to: Cloudflare Pages > zeropoint-protocol > Settings > Environment variables

Set the following variables:

```
BUILD_COMMIT = 1604e587
BUILD_TIME = 2025-09-09T18:30:00Z
CI_STATUS = green
MOCKS_DISABLED = 1
TRAINING_ENABLED = 1
GOVERNANCE_MODE = dual-consensus
SYNTHIENTS_ACTIVE = 1
```

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Trigger Deployment
```bash
# Option A: Via Wrangler CLI (if available)
wrangler pages deploy . --project-name=zeropoint-protocol --branch=main

# Option B: Via GitHub Integration
# Push to main branch to trigger automatic deployment
git push origin main

# Option C: Manual Cloudflare Dashboard
# Go to Cloudflare Pages > zeropoint-protocol > Create deployment
# Select branch: main
# Override build settings if necessary
```

### 2. Verify Environment Variables
After deployment starts, verify in Cloudflare Pages dashboard that all environment variables are set correctly.

### 3. Monitor Deployment
Monitor the deployment logs in Cloudflare Pages dashboard for any build errors.

## Post-Deployment Verification

Execute these commands immediately after deployment completes:

```bash
# Verify version endpoint
curl -i https://zeropointprotocol.ai/status/version.json

# Expected response:
# HTTP/1.1 200 OK
# Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
# Cache-Control: no-store
# X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
#
# {
#   "phase": "stage1",
#   "commit": "1604e587",
#   "ciStatus": "green",
#   "buildTime": "2025-09-09T18:30:00Z",
#   "env": "prod",
#   "TRAINING_ENABLED": "1"
# }

# Verify evidence endpoint serves JSON
curl -H "Accept: application/json" https://zeropointprotocol.ai/evidence/phase1/verify/1604e587/index.json | jq .meta.commit

# Expected: "1604e587"

# Verify all endpoints
curl -f https://zeropointprotocol.ai/api/healthz
curl -f https://zeropointprotocol.ai/api/readyz
curl -f https://zeropointprotocol.ai/api/training/status
curl -f https://zeropointprotocol.ai/api/proposals
curl -f https://zeropointprotocol.ai/api/consensus/proposals
```

## Critical Success Factors

### ✅ Must Verify - Commit Alignment
- `/status/version.json` returns `commit: "1604e587"`
- All evidence references canonical commit
- No drift between repo and live site

### ✅ Must Verify - Evidence JSON
- `/evidence/phase1/verify/1604e587/index.json` serves pure JSON
- No HTML shell override
- `first120` fields populated

### ✅ Must Verify - Security Headers
- All endpoints return required headers
- `Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8`
- `Cache-Control: no-store`
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`

## Emergency Rollback Plan

If deployment fails:

1. **Immediate Rollback:** Deploy previous working commit
2. **Root Cause Analysis:** Check build logs for environment variable issues
3. **Fix and Redeploy:** Correct environment variables and redeploy
4. **Escalation:** Notify CEO if rollback required

## Timeline Requirements

- **T+0 minutes:** Start deployment process
- **T+15 minutes:** Verify environment variables set
- **T+30 minutes:** Complete deployment
- **T+45 minutes:** Execute verification tests
- **T+60 minutes:** Confirm success or initiate rollback

## Contact Information

- **DevOps Lead:** Execute immediately upon receipt
- **Escalation Path:** Dev Team Lead → CEO (if deployment blocked)
- **Status Updates:** Provide real-time updates during execution

## Success Confirmation

Send confirmation message upon completion:

```
✅ DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE
- Commit: 1604e587 aligned
- Evidence: JSON serving correctly
- Headers: Security enforced
- Endpoints: All 200 OK
- Proposal Gate: READY FOR EXECUTION
```

**Intent:** GOD FIRST, execute immediately to complete Truth-to-Repo alignment and advance to Proposal Gate.
