# Zeropoint Protocol Architecture

## Overview
Zeropoint Protocol is a secure, ethical AI ecosystem built on Cloudflare Pages with serverless functions.

## Architecture Components

### Frontend
- Static HTML pages with noscript fallbacks
- JavaScript for dynamic content loading
- Responsive design with accessibility focus

### Backend
- Cloudflare Functions for API endpoints
- Serverless execution with edge computing
- Automatic scaling and global distribution

### Infrastructure
- Cloudflare Pages for hosting
- Git-based deployment with CI/CD
- Evidence collection and verification

## Security Model
- Zeroth Principle enforcement
- Security headers on all endpoints
- Evidence transparency and verification
- Automated compliance checking

## Data Flow
1. Client requests status endpoint
2. Function reads from evidence files
3. Response with security headers
4. Evidence collection and logging
