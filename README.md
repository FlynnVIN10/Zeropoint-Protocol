# Zeropoint Protocol

**Advanced AI Agent System with Ethical AI Principles**

Zeropoint Protocol is a comprehensive AI agent system featuring multi-agent collaboration, decentralized storage, and ethical AI principles with Zeroth-gate compliance.

## üéØ **Core Features**

- **ü§ñ Multi-Agent Intelligence**: Swarm collaboration and collective cognition
- **üîó Decentralized Storage**: IPFS-based ledger and persistent memory
- **‚öñÔ∏è Ethical AI**: Zeroth-gate compliance for responsible AI development
- **üß† Autopoietic Cognition**: Recursive self-training and adaptation
- **üéÆ Gamified Experience**: XP progression and WonderCraft simulation
- **üîê Secure Authentication**: JWT-based user management and protection

- All endpoints are versioned under `/v1/`.
- Proxy endpoints (e.g., `/v1/generate-text`) forward to Python backend using HttpModule.
- Persistent storage via PostgreSQL/TypeORM; User entity for registration/login.
- JWT authentication with `/v1/register`, `/v1/login`, and `/v1/protected` endpoints.
- Prometheus metrics exposed at `/v1/metrics` and `/v1/ledger-metrics`.
- All sensitive flows and endpoints are Zeroth-gated for ethical compliance.
- All secrets (DB, JWT, etc.) are loaded from environment variables (`process.env`).

## Example Usage

### Register
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/register -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"user1","password":"pass1"}'
```

### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/v1/login -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"username":"user1","password":"pass1"}'
```

### Access Protected Route
```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <access_token>" http://localhost:3000/v1/protected
```

### Prometheus Metrics
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/metrics
curl http://localhost:3000/v1/ledger-metrics
```
