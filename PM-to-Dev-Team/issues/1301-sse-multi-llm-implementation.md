# Issue #1301: SSE & Multi-LLM Implementation

**Type**: Feature  
**Priority**: High  
**Phase**: 14 Sprint  
**Epic**: Live Features Delivery  
**Owner**: BE Team  
**Estimate**: 8h  
**Due**: D+2  

## Description

Implement `/v1/stream` endpoint with provider router and failover for OpenAI/Anthropic as specified in Phase 14 Sprint Task 1.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] **SSE Endpoint**: Implement `/v1/stream` with Server-Sent Events
- [ ] **Provider Router**: Support OpenAI and Anthropic with automatic failover
- [ ] **Failover Logic**: Switch providers in <5s when primary fails
- [ ] **Load Testing**: Support 500 concurrent connections
- [ ] **Success Rate**: Achieve 99% success rate under load

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement DDoS prevention (threat model required)
- [ ] **Bias Checks**: Include bias detection in routing logic
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] **E2E Tests**: End-to-end integration testing
- [ ] **Load Tests**: k6/JMeter report for 500 concurrent users

### Security & Ethics Requirements
- [ ] **Threat Model**: DDoS prevention strategy documented
- [ ] **Bias Mitigation**: Routing logic includes bias detection
- [ ] **Rate Limiting**: Implement per-user and per-endpoint limits
- [ ] **Audit Logging**: Log all provider switches and failures

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **SSE Streaming**: Endpoint streams real-time data via Server-Sent Events
2. **Provider Failover**: Automatic failover completes in <5 seconds
3. **Load Performance**: 500 concurrent connections with 99% success rate
4. **Test Coverage**: Unit and E2E tests pass with >90% coverage
5. **Security**: Rate limiting and bias checks implemented
6. **Documentation**: API docs and threat model completed

## Dependencies

- **None** - This is the first task in the dependency chain

## Implementation Details

### New Files Created
- `src/controllers/stream.controller.ts` - Main SSE controller
- `scripts/phase14-sse-load-test.js` - Load testing script

### Modified Files
- `src/app.module.ts` - Added StreamController

### Endpoints
- `GET /v1/stream/stream` - SSE connection establishment
- `POST /v1/stream/generate` - Streaming text generation
- `GET /v1/stream/providers/status` - Provider health status
- `GET /v1/stream/providers/health` - Detailed provider health

### Provider Routing Logic
- Health-based provider selection
- Automatic failover on provider failure
- Load balancing across healthy providers
- Real-time health monitoring

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Controller methods
- Provider selection logic
- Failover mechanisms
- Error handling

### Integration Tests
- SSE connection lifecycle
- Provider switching
- Error scenarios
- Rate limiting

### Load Tests
- 500 concurrent connections
- Success rate measurement
- Latency profiling
- Failover timing

### Security Tests
- Rate limiting validation
- DDoS prevention
- Bias detection accuracy

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] Tests passing with >90% coverage
- [ ] Load test results documented
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] PR merged to main branch

## Risk Assessment

**Risk**: Load test flakes during CI/CD  
**Mitigation**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff  
**Owner**: BE Team  
**Rollback**: Revert to mock endpoints
