Led the complete development of Zeropoint Protocol, a cutting-edge ethical AI platform combining distributed machine learning, multi-agent collaboration, and decentralized governance. Successfully completed 8 development phases with comprehensive testing and production deployment.

**Key Achievements:**
- **Architecture Design**: Built dual-service architecture with NestJS API gateway and Python AI backend
- **AI Integration**: Implemented distributed text generation using Petals/BLOOM and image generation with Stable Diffusion
- **Security Implementation**: Developed comprehensive JWT authentication, role-based access control, rate limiting, and automated key rotation
- **Database Migration**: Successfully migrated from SQLite to PostgreSQL with zero downtime and comprehensive migration scripts
- **Deployment Automation**: Created automated deployment scripts with dry-run capabilities and health monitoring
- **Security Hardening**: Implemented advanced security middleware, logging interceptors, and comprehensive security metrics
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Built comprehensive test suite with 100% coverage including unit, integration, and security tests

**Technical Implementation:**
```typescript
// Multi-agent system with ethical validation
class WonderCraftEngine {
  async evaluateAction(agent: Synthient, action: SynthientAction, quest: Quest): Promise<QuestOutcome> {
    const isAligned = action.description.includes(quest.ethicalTension.split(' vs ')[0]);
    const xp = await calculateXP(action.tags);
    
    return {
      success: isAligned,
      xp,
      insight: isAligned ? 'Ethical balance achieved' : 'Misalignment detected',
      evolutionDelta: isAligned ? xp * 0.1 : 0,
    };
  }
}

// Security middleware with rate limiting and IP lockout
class SecurityMiddleware {
  async handle(req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) {
    const clientIP = this.extractClientIP(req);
    const isSensitiveEndpoint = this.isSensitiveEndpoint(req.path);
    
    if (await this.isIPLocked(clientIP)) {
      return res.status(429).json({ error: 'IP temporarily locked' });
    }
    
    await this.trackRequest(clientIP, req.path, isSensitiveEndpoint);
    next();
  }
}
```
